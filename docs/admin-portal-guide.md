# Too Funny Productions Admin Guide

## 1. Overview
The admin dashboard (`/admin`) lets allow-listed Google accounts manage public site content, media assets, and publishing workflows without touching code. This guide covers the tools available in each section and the standard editing flow so your team can safely collaborate on updates.

## 2. Access & Roles
- **Sign in with Google:** Visiting `/admin` prompts users to sign in. Only emails on the allowlist (see Section 7) or configured in the environment can pass the `AdminGuard`. Others will see the "Admin access required" screen with a sign-in button.
- **User bar:** Once signed in, the top-right user menu displays the active account, draft/live stage indicator, and a sign-out action.
- **Session timeout:** Draft sessions automatically time out based on the "Admin Session Timeout" setting (Section 5.5). Sign in again to continue.

## 3. Layout & Navigation
- **Sidebar:** Fixed links for the four admin modules—General Settings, Page Configurations, Media Manager, and Audit Log. Active sections highlight in yellow.
- **Quick Links:** Up to four shortcuts appear under the navigation. Configure them in **General Settings → Admin Quick Links**.
- **Mobile view:** On small screens, open the hamburger menu to reveal navigation and quick links.
- **Content area:** All editors open inside the main panel. Most pages share the same draft controls described below.

## 4. Draft Workflow & Publishing
Content edits always happen on the **Draft** stage, then move to **Live** once reviewed.

> **Need to build:** The items in Sections 4.2–4.7 are functional requirements for the admin workflow. Use the checklist below when planning engineering work so the UI, backend APIs, and audit log all support the behaviors authors expect.

### 4.0 Implementation checklist
- Draft lock acquisition opens a modal that lists all drafts and snapshots, with metadata (name, author, last edit, quick note) and the ability to clone the current Live snapshot into a brand-new draft.
- Draft viewers without the lock stay in read-only mode but can inspect the active editor’s WIP snapshot.
- Releasing a lock confirms unsaved changes and records an auto-saved draft when the editor chooses to exit without manually saving; the same auto-save runs on inactivity logout.
- Snapshot management enforces the 20-draft / 10-published limits, quick notes are editable, and every save/delete/restore action is written to the Audit Log with actor + timestamp.
- Scheduling UI enforces non-overlapping windows, supports push-now overrides with confirmation + audit trail, allows specifying follow-up snapshots or the global default, and automatically reverts when the window ends.
- Auto logout shows a countdown warning, auto-saves the open draft, labels it accordingly, and records the event in the Audit Log.

### 4.1 Stage selector
Use the dropdown at the top of General Settings to switch between **Live** (read-only preview) and **Draft** (editable). All inputs disable automatically when viewing Live or when another editor owns the draft lock.

### 4.2 Draft locking
- **Acquire lock & pick your starting point:** Clicking **Acquire** opens a chooser that lets you resume an existing draft (tagged with name, author, last edit time, and quick note) or load any snapshot as-is. You can always start a fresh draft from the current Live snapshot—the system clones Live into Draft for you.
- **Read-only when another admin is editing:** If someone else owns the lock, you can still inspect their work in Draft mode but inputs remain disabled until they release or you start your own draft from Live.
- **Release lock:** When finished, click **Release** so teammates can edit. If unsaved changes exist, you’ll be prompted to save or intentionally discard. Choosing to release without saving creates an auto-labeled draft snapshot so nothing is lost.
- **Status indicator:** Shows whether you hold the lock, another editor does, or no lock exists. Errors appear in red if a lock request fails.

### 4.3 Saving & syncing
- **Save Draft:** Persists your pending changes to the Draft stage. Enabled only when Draft is dirty and unlocked. Auto-saves also trigger before an inactivity logout so you can resume later (the snapshot note records that it was auto-saved).
- **Pull Current Live:** Copies Live content into Draft without publishing—useful to reset the draft before editing.
- **Preview Draft:** Opens the public site with `?stage=draft` so you can review in context.
- **Snapshots:** Opens the draft snapshots modal for checkpoint management.

### 4.4 Publishing
When Draft is ready, click **Publish to Live**. This copies the draft values to the Live stage. Ensure you hold the lock and have saved the latest edits first.

### 4.5 Draft snapshots & recovery
The **Snapshots** modal lets you:
- Save up to 20 draft snapshots per admin workspace, each with a required name, optional quick note (free-form, editable after save), and metadata showing creator and last update time.
- Store up to 10 deployed snapshots in the published pool for disaster recovery. Any admin can publish one of these directly or pull it into their Draft view.
- Restore a snapshot back into Draft after confirming the overwrite prompt. The system reloads settings and reacquires the lock for you.
- Delete outdated snapshots. Actions are audited and require confirmation.

All snapshot and draft save events log to the Audit Log, including manual and automatic saves.

### 4.6 Draft safety tips
- Save frequently and release the lock when idle.
- Coordinate larger changes by naming snapshots (e.g., "Spring homepage refresh").
- Use Pull Current Live to recover from accidental edits.

### 4.7 Scheduling & publishing windows
- **Push Now:** Immediately deploys the selected snapshot to Live after the usual confirmation checklist.
- **Schedule deployment:** Choose a snapshot, start time, optional end time, and successor snapshot (or the global default) to restore when the window closes. Schedules cannot overlap—if a conflict arises, the UI prompts you to adjust either the existing or new window.
- **Interrupting a schedule:** Attempting to Push Now during an active scheduled deployment triggers a confirmation explaining the impact. Confirming cancels the remainder of the schedule and records the override in the Audit Log.
- **End-of-window behavior:** When a scheduled window ends, the system automatically applies the designated follow-up—either the default snapshot or the next scheduled deployment if it begins immediately. Gaps revert to the default snapshot.

The Audit Log tracks who scheduled, modified, cancelled, or ran deployments, including overrides and automatic reverts.

## 5. General Settings Module
This section controls global branding, theming, footer content, maintenance windows, quick links, and session policies.

### 5.1 Branding & SEO

### 6.3 Events
- **Page title & intro copy.**
- **Upcoming events:** Add rows with title, date, venue, and ticket link. URLs auto-normalize to include HTTPS.
- **Past events:** Same editor for archived shows. Remove entries you no longer want to display.

### 6.4 Media
- **Hero copy:** Intro title and paragraph for the media page.
- **Featured videos & galleries:** Manage lists of video embeds and image grids. Each item supports title, description, URL, and thumbnail where applicable.

- **Product cards:** Add/edit items with name, description, price, image, purchase link, and optional badge (e.g., "New").
- **Purchase links:** Automatically normalized to full URLs.

### 6.6 Contact
- **Hero copy:** Headline, subheading, and supporting text.
- **Contact cards:** Configure multiple cards with label, description, button text/link, and icon.

## 7. Admin Access (Allowlist Manager)
Located beneath General Settings, this tool lets you manage which Google accounts can reach the dashboard.
- **Editable allowlist:** Add addresses one per line. Press **Enter** or click **Add** to queue them before saving.
- **Environment emails:** Read-only addresses configured by developers. They always retain access even if not listed in the editable section.
- **Save changes:** Click **Save allowlist** to persist updates. Success and error banners appear inline.
- **Remove:** Use the **Remove** button next to an address to revoke access. Changes apply on the next login.

## 8. Media Manager Module
A standalone media library for the Supabase storage bucket.
- **Upload:** Click **Upload files** and select one or more assets. Upload progress disables the button until complete.
- **Search & sort:** Filter by filename and sort by newest, oldest, name, or size.
- **Copy URL:** Use the copy icon to place the public asset URL on your clipboard (fallback prompt appears if clipboard access fails).
- **Rename:** Prompt-based rename that keeps file type extensions intact.
- **Delete:** Permanently remove files after confirmation. Deleted assets disappear from the list immediately.

## 9. Audit Log Module
Review a searchable history of admin actions, publishes, uploads, and snapshot events.
- **Filters:** Search text, filter by actor email, action type, result limit, and newest/oldest ordering.
- **Refresh:** Reload data on demand; auto-refresh also runs shortly after you change filters.
- **Details:** Each row shows timestamp, actor, action badge, and JSON-formatted metadata for troubleshooting.
- **Reset:** Clear all filters with the **Reset** button.

## 10. Best Practices
1. **Communicate lock ownership:** Post in your team chat when acquiring the draft lock for major edits.
2. **Name snapshots:** Descriptive labels help future editors understand what changed.
3. **Verify links:** The admin normalizes URLs, but it cannot guarantee the destination works. Always test external links.
4. **Purge unused media:** Keep storage tidy by deleting outdated uploads.
5. **Audit regularly:** Review the Audit Log after large updates to confirm who published and when.

## 11. Troubleshooting
- **Cannot edit fields:** Ensure you are in Draft view and hold the draft lock. If another editor is active, coordinate a handoff.
- **Draft changes missing:** Confirm you clicked **Save Draft** before navigating away. Restore a recent snapshot if needed.
- **Allowlist updates failing:** Check the error banner for API details. Retry after a few seconds; persistent issues may indicate server-side configuration problems.
- **Upload errors:** Large files or unsupported formats may fail. Check console logs or try again after refreshing.
- **Preview mismatch:** Verify the preview tab is loading with `?stage=draft`. Clear browser cache if the live site appears instead.

## 12. Quick Reference Checklist
- Acquire draft lock → Switch to Draft → Make edits → Save Draft → Snapshot (optional) → Preview → Publish to Live → Release lock.
- Update allowlist whenever new admins join or depart.
- Periodically clean the media library and review the audit trail.
