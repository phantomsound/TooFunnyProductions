# Data source configuration ---------------------------------------------------
# Supply the PostgREST endpoint that fronts your primary PostgreSQL database.
# - While Supabase is still the source of truth, this is the hosted
#   `https://<project>.supabase.co` URL plus the matching service key.
# - After migrating to your local PostgreSQL instance, point this at the
#   self-hosted PostgREST/Supabase stack that serves the **local** database
#   (for example `http://127.0.0.1:54321` when using the Supabase CLI).
# - When you are ready to retire Supabase entirely, delete the old hosted URL
#   and service key from your secrets store so the backend only talks to the
#   local database.
